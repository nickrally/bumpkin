He calls a slegih as daylight's dimming;
The cry resounds: 'Make way! Let's go!'
His collar with its bever trimming
Is silver bright with frosted snow.
He's off to Talon's, late and racing,
Quite sure he'll find Kaverin pacing;
He enters - cork and bottle spout!
The comet wine comes out gushing out,
A bloody roastbeef's on the table,
And truffles, youth's delight so keen,
The very flower of French cuisine,
And Strasburg pie, that deathless fable,
While next to Limburg's lively mould
Sits ananas in splended gold
